### Providing Data Confidentiality üîê

**What does "Providing Data Confidentiality" mean?**

Providing **data confidentiality** means ensuring that sensitive information is accessible only to **authorized users**. This is achieved through **encryption**, which transforms data into a format that is unreadable without the proper **decryption key**.

**What is a Cipher?**

A **cipher** is a **code** or **algorithm** that uses a **secret key** to conceal data, making it unreadable to anyone who does not possess the key.

**What is Encryption?**

**Encryption** is the process of converting readable data (**plaintext**) into an unreadable format (**ciphertext**) using an **algorithm** and a **key**, ensuring that only authorized users can access the original data.

**What is Decryption?**

**Decryption** is the reverse process of encryption, where **ciphertext** is converted back into **plaintext** using a key, allowing authorized users to read the original data.

**What is Symmetric Encryption and When is it Used?**

**Symmetric encryption** uses the **same key** for both encryption and decryption. It is used when both the **sender** and **receiver** can securely share the same key.

**What is Asymmetric Encryption and When is it Used?**

**Asymmetric encryption** uses a pair of keys: a **public key** for encryption and a **private key** for decryption. It is used when secure key distribution is needed, as the private key is kept **secret** while the public key is shared.

### Ensuring Data Integrity üõ°Ô∏è

**What is a Hash?**

A **hash** is a **one-way function** that converts data into a fixed-size string of characters, typically a **hash code**. It ensures that data has not been altered by generating a unique hash value for the original data.

**How Does Hashing Work?**

**Hashing** transforms input data into a unique hash value through a **mathematical function**. Any change in the input data will result in a different hash value, helping to detect data modifications.

**Compare Encryption vs. Hashing**

| Feature           | **Encryption**                    | **Hashing**                              |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**       | To conceal data using a key       | To verify data integrity                 |
| **Reversibility** | Reversible (can be decrypted)     | Non-reversible (one-way function)        |
| **Key Usage**     | Uses encryption keys              | No keys involved                         |
| **Use Case**      | Securing data during transmission | Ensuring data integrity and verification |

**Describe the SHA Family**

The **SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm)** family includes various hash functions such as **SHA-1**, **SHA-256**, and **SHA-3**, each producing different lengths of hash values and offering varying levels of **security**.

### Using Cryptographic Techniques üîë

**What Does "Securing Data" Mean?**

**Securing data** involves protecting information through **cryptographic techniques** such as **encryption** and **hashing** to prevent unauthorized access and modifications.

**What Are Security Services?**

**Security services** include:

- **Confidentiality:** Protecting data from unauthorized access.
- **Integrity:** Ensuring data has not been altered.
- **Authentication:** Verifying the identity of users or systems.
- **Accountability:** Tracking and logging user actions for audit purposes.

**What is VPN?**

A **VPN (Virtual Private Network)** creates a **secure**, **encrypted connection** over a less secure network, such as the internet, to ensure **data privacy** and **integrity**.

**What is Blockchain?**

**Blockchain** is a decentralized **digital ledger** that records transactions across multiple computers, ensuring that records cannot be altered retroactively without changing all subsequent blocks.

**How to Secure Email?**

**Securing email** involves using encryption protocols like **S/MIME** (**Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions**) to protect email content from unauthorized access.

### Securing Email üìß

**What Does "Securing Email" Mean?**

**Securing email** involves protecting email communications from unauthorized access and attacks, ensuring that sensitive information remains **confidential**.

**What Are Mail Attacks?**

**Mail attacks** include:

- **Spam:** Unsolicited and often irrelevant or inappropriate messages.
- **Spoofing:** Faking the sender's address to deceive recipients.
- **Phishing:** Attempting to acquire sensitive information by pretending to be a trustworthy entity.
- **Malware:** Malicious software delivered via email attachments or links.

**What Are Phishing Attacks?**

**Phishing attacks** are attempts to trick individuals into providing **sensitive information**, such as **passwords** or **financial details**, by pretending to be a legitimate entity.

**How to Defend Against Email Threats?**

- **Think Before Opening Links or Attachments:** Avoid clicking on suspicious links or downloading attachments from unknown sources.
- **Use Antimalware Protection:** Install and regularly update **antimalware software** to detect and remove threats.
- **Keep Your Browser Updated:** Ensure your **browser** is up-to-date to protect against vulnerabilities and check for forgery.
